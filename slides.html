              <p>One reason we broke epics into slices is because humans have a
              hard time estimating as the thing gets bigger. Story points
              account for this by increasing the gap between values.</p>

              <p>Shirt sizes can help if points are a problem. Small = 3. XL =
              13. I don't like it as much, but you can only say "points are not
              hours" so many times. If you can't get away from hours, use shirt
              sizes.</p>

              <p>Also, 20, 40, and 100 <em>are valid estimates</em>, but that's
              an epic to break down. They make great budget placeholder
