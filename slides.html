              <p>One reason we broke epics into thin slices is because humans have
              a hard time estimating with precision as the thing becomes bigger
              or more complicated. This applies with story points, too.</p>

              <p>Shirt sizes can help if points are a problem. Small = 3. XL =
              13. I don't like it as much, but you can only say "points are not
              hours" so many times.</p>

              <p>Also, 20 and 40 <em>are valid estimates</em>, but it's a sign
              that the team probably shouldn't take on the story until it is
              further defined and broken down.</p>

              less was deliverable and completed this sprint. And next sprint

              <p>Also, when gathering information for a story or working on
