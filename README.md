# Estimate for Iteration with Story Points and Thin Vertical Slices

At [Four Kitchens](https://www.fourkitchens.com), we use
[Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) to manage
most of our projects. In doing so, we've learned to break down business
requirements into *thin vertical slices* of functionality, usually written as
user stories. In doing so, teams can ensure that planning, frontend components,
backend functionality, and user training/demos come together in sync by being
worked on with a unified focus, even as requirements fluctuate through the life
of a product or client engagement.

Estimating these "pieces of work" by using *story points* side-steps the
pitfalls of granular, hours-based estimation and equips Product Owners/Project
Managers and Stakeholders to make *informed* prioritization decisions.
Estimating is never perfect, but over time, a team will tend toward a
predictable velocity which can be used to help plan sprints or releases.

After talking about these concepts and how to put them to work in theory, we
will look at how Jira supports this method: using story points for sprint
building, using reports for longer-term planning, and how sub-tasks can help aid
a split workflow situation like component-driven design or the classic "backend
vs. frontend" argument.
