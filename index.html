          At Four Kitchens, we use Scrum to manage most of our projects. In
          doing so, we've learned to  break down business requirements into
          *thin vertical slices* of functionality, usually written as user
          stories. In doing so, teams can ensure that planning, frontend
          components, backend functionality, and user training/demos come
          together in sync by being worked on with a unified focus, even as
          requirements fluctuate through the life of a product or client
          engagement.
        </p>

        <p>
          Estimating these "pieces of work" by using *story points* side-steps
          the pitfalls of granular, hours-based estimation and equips Product
          Owners/Project Managers and Stakeholders to make *informed*
          prioritization decisions. Estimating is never perfect, but over time,
          a team will tend toward a predictable velocity which can be used to
          help plan sprints or releases.
        </p>

        <p>
          After talking about these concepts and how to put them to work in
          theory, we will look at how Jira supports this method: using story
          points for sprint building, using reports for longer-term planning,
          and how sub-tasks can help aid a split workflow situation like
          component-driven design or the classic "backend vs. frontend"
          argument.
        </p>

        <p>
          These are the two concepts I introduce to all my teams and clients as
          projects begin, so knowledge of Scrum or Kanban is not required! I
          encourage developers and managers alike to join for this conversation
          because the key to a successful project is a shared understanding of
          how it is structured. These techniques work for Scrum or Kanban style
          agile development and are not specific to Drupal or particular project
          management tools.
