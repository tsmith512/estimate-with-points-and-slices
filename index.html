        <p>
          Over the years, I've used Scrum to manage most of my product builds
          projects. In doing so, I break down business requirements into
          <em>thin vertical slices</em> of functionality, usually written as
          user stories. This way, teams can ensure that planning, all elements
          of development (like frontend components or backend functionality),
          and user training/demos come together in sync by being worked on with
          a unified focus. Even better, framing work this way ensures we're
          always ready to address a pivot or change in requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
          Estimating these "pieces of work" by using <em>story points</em>
          side-steps the pitfalls of hours-based estimation and equips Product
          Owners/Managers and Stakeholders to make better informed
          prioritization choices. Estimating is never perfect, but over time, a
          team will tend toward a predictable velocity which can be used to help
          plan sprints and releases.
        </p>

        <p>
          After talking about these concepts and how to put them to work in
          theory, we will look at how Jira supports this method: using story
          points for sprint building, using reports for longer-term planning,
          and how sub-tasks can help aid a split workflow situation like
          component-driven design or the classic "backend vs. frontend"
          argument.
        </p>

        <p>
          These are the two concepts I introduce to all my teams and clients as
          projects begin, so knowledge of Scrum or Kanban is not required! I
          encourage developers and managers alike to join for this conversation
          because the key to a successful project is a shared understanding of
          how it is structured. These techniques work for Scrum or Kanban style
          agile development and are not specific to Drupal or particular project
          management tools.
